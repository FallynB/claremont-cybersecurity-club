Dear Cyber Club Members,

I write this letter to address the intention of the club and its hopeful place within the CMC community.

Technology is beautiful because there is always (usually always) more than one way to go about doing something. Approaches have to be creative in nature. As long as one has the perseverance to keep pushing forward in finding a solution and the resources to keep them afloat - the sky is the limit. This fact alone makes me take technology very seriously.

The other aspect of me is troubled. I have never felt "at home" in academic spaces. I do my best. I memorize. I show up. My passion, though, has always been in using my curiosity to figure things out. Oftentimes, I feel extremely constrained in doing so both in the classroom and school setting. Traditionally, the education system teaches us that there is a correct way, approach, and standard for how things should be completed. If your work is outside of the guidelines they expect for every student, it is ranked or labeled as less than.

Fundamentally, I dispute this. I appreciate academia for its structure, but I feel that as students, we should be getting our hands dirty in fields of passion. Wholeheartedly, I do believe in measuring twice and cutting once. We should be calculated in our decision making. There is a quality and a standard to uphold, but the process of doing so should not be one of constriction and reprimand.

Real discoveries. Important impact. Trying nothing less than our absolute best. That is the ethos of The Claremont Cybersecurity Club.

Hacker culture has especially stood out to me. I have found a home in it. Despite common misconceptions, hackers are intellectual beings in their own respect. The finger pointing of morality can be skewed in any profession. Regardless, it is respectable to bend the mold, current existing structure to figure out how one can improve it. The process allows for better decisions to be made. I genuinely admire the amount of consistency, knowledge, and skill that it takes to accomplish the things that those with enough technical proficiency can do. It makes me want to be a master of my craft.

A "hacker" is someone who does some sort of interesting and creative work at a high intensity level ([MIT](https://hacks.mit.edu/misc/faq.html)). They find paths where there are none cut out. It requires a commendable amount of foresight, determination, logic, and down right methodical consistency. The internal reward for that is enough to keep pushing forward. Let's push forward with the intention of improving the spaces in which we exist. The technological capabilities of the institution can be propelled greatly if there are enough people who truly believe they have something to contribute and make changes.

As we go forward in this semester, I encourage you all to figure out your motivations, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Use them to propel you forward. The only box that you are in is the one you have put yourself in.

The beautiful thing about life is that if you do not like the mold, you can recast it.

Yours Truly,
