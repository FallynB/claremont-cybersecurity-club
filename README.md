# Claremont CyberSecurity Club: About Us 🌟🛡️💻

The Claremont Cybersecurity Club is intended to be a space of development for all those interested in learning more about security or integrating it into their existing workflows. Whether you're interested in building secure software, integrating security into your design process, or understanding more about networking and penetrating systems, our club is the place for you to become more comfortable and competent in these areas.

Remember: Security shouldn't be an afterthought. It should be a conscious component taken just as seriously as any other general software considerations.

## Software Engineering vs Security Roles 🔄

Cybersecurity has traditionally been viewed as a subcategory of the broader information technology field. However, as developers and aspiring security professionals, we emphasize that security should be integrated into all aspects of software development and IT operations.

## Core Cybersecurity Club Concepts 🎯

- Zero Trust 🔒
- Least Privileged Access 🔑
- Automation 🤖
- On-Premises vs. Cloud ☁️

## Security+ Training 📝

Security+ certification is a valuable asset in the cybersecurity field. Here's our approach:

- We will have study groups to support your learning
- Small group projects will be organized around specific topics for hands-on experience and reinforcement
- Exam vouchers will be provided, and we'll sit for the exam together

## Team Projects 🏗️

We aim to recreate systems that mirror industry practices:

- Agile methodology
- GitHub: We'll utilize the project planning subsection and assign roles for accountability in every project
- Frequent (weekly) meetings to build out projects together and study
- A CyberClub Slack channel will be set up for easy communication
- A list of projects can be seen below. We welcome new ideas - bring them up in meetings, add them to the new idea Google form, or mention them to a club member to get started.
