# Security+ Certification at CMC

## Why Certifications Matter in IT

IT certifications are crucial alongside degrees. They offer targeted expertise that employers value. Certifications show practical skills and keep you updated in a fast-changing field. They can lead to new job opportunities and higher salaries.

Degrees give broad knowledge. Certifications provide specialized, practical skills. Having both gives you an advantage in the job market.

## Why We Offer Security+

CMC's Data Science and Harvey Mudd's CS programs don't cover cybersecurity. There's no curriculum for those interested in cyber defense. Security+ bridges this gap.

Security+ will teach you about:
- Network security
- Cybersecurity essentials
- Technical vocabulary

Our goal is to prepare you for real cyber work. We want you to understand and apply these concepts, not just pass an exam.
