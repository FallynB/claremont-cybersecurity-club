# Secure File Vault Project: Comprehensive Overview and Statement of Work

## Background

The Secure File Vault is an existing Flask-based web application designed to provide secure file storage and management. The application currently implements core functionalities such as user authentication, file encryption/decryption, and secure file upload/download mechanisms. As part of our ongoing commitment to security and feature enhancement, we are expanding the project to include additional security measures and user collaboration features.

## Project Objectives

1. Enhance the existing Secure File Vault application with advanced security features
2. Implement user-to-user file sharing capabilities
3. Improve the overall security posture of the application
4. Prepare the application for secure deployment in a production environment

## Secure by Design Principle

Our project adheres to the Secure by Design principle, which emphasizes:

1. Integrating security measures from the initial planning and design phases
2. Proactively identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities
3. Continuously assessing and improving security throughout the development lifecycle
4. Fostering a security-minded culture among all team members

## Statement of Work

### 1. New Feature Development

#### 1.1 Secure User-to-User File Sharing
- Develop a mechanism for users to grant access to their files to other users
- Implement robust access control checks for shared files
- Ensure the principle of least privilege is respected in file sharing

#### 1.2 Enhanced Logging and Auditing
- Create a comprehensive logging system for all file operations
- Implement tamper-resistant log storage
- Develop an audit trail for administrative actions

#### 1.3 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Add support for time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
- Integrate with popular MFA providers or implement a custom solution

### 2. Security Enhancements

#### 2.1 Secure Key Management
- Implement a dedicated key management system
- Develop and implement key rotation policies

#### 2.2 Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Implement file type restrictions and content analysis
- Add watermarking to downloaded files for tracking

#### 2.3 Rate Limiting and Anti-Automation Measures
- Implement protection against brute force attacks and API abuse
- Add CAPTCHAs or similar challenges for sensitive operations

#### 2.4 Enhanced Secure Communication
- Implement perfect forward secrecy in TLS configuration
- Explore the use of secure websockets for real-time updates

### 3. Deployment and Hosting

#### 3.1 Cloud Hosting Research and Implementation
- Evaluate secure cloud hosting providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Implement the chosen hosting solution with security best practices

#### 3.2 Containerization
- Containerize the application using Docker
- Implement security best practices for container deployment

#### 3.3 Security-Focused Deployment
- Set up a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
- Ensure proper HTTPS configuration and certificate management
- Design and implement network segmentation

### 4. Ongoing Security Measures

#### 4.1 Vulnerability Disclosure Program
- Establish a responsible disclosure policy
- Create a process for handling and addressing reported vulnerabilities

#### 4.2 Regular Security Assessments
- Conduct periodic penetration tests
- Perform regular vulnerability scans
- Address identified issues promptly

## Project Collaboration Structure

1. All team members will use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
2. Work will be done in feature branches, with pull requests for code reviews and merging
3. A GitHub Project board will be used for task management and progress tracking
4. Regular team meetings will be held to discuss progress, challenges, and security considerations

## Documentation Requirements

1. All new features and security measures must be thoroughly documented
2. Code comments should explain the security implications of critical sections
3. A user guide should be maintained, explaining how to use the application securely
4. All security decisions and risk assessments should be documented

## Team Communication

1. A dedicated Slack workspace will be used for team communication
2. Weekly status reports will be submitted by each team member
3. Monthly all-hands meetings will be held to discuss project progress and align on security goals

## Success Criteria

1. All planned features are implemented and thoroughly tested
2. Penetration testing reveals no critical or high-risk vulnerabilities
3. The application is successfully deployed in a secure production environment
4. Comprehensive documentation is completed for all aspects of the project

By following this statement of work, team members will contribute to building a highly secure, feature-rich file storage and sharing application. This project will provide valuable experience in applying Secure by Design principles to a real-world application, enhancing both the security skills and software development capabilities of all participants.
